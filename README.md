# `version`

Simply get the version information from Go [`BuildInfo`](https://pkg.go.dev/runtime/debug#BuildInfo).

Usage:

```
import "github.com/imjasonh/version"

func main() {
    fmt.Println(version.Get())
}
```

This code is not maintained, and I will not accept PRs to add features. Fork it if you want it. It's like 50 lines, just copy it into your codebase and go to town.

Please stop using `ldflags` to embed this information.

### Rant

Since the early days of Go, if you wanted to embed something like the Git commit that was built in your binary, you had to do something janky like

```
package main

const commit = "unknown"
```

and

```
go build -ldflags="-X 'main.commit=$(git rev-parse HEAD)'"
```

This was kinda gross, but it worked, so people did it. And _boy_ did they do it. This little trick got cargo-culted all over the place! Anecdotally, basically any Go application you use has its version embedded this way.

Don't believe me? [Here's about 76,000 hits on GitHub for `ldflags` and `golang` in `Makefile`s](https://github.com/search?type=code&q=ldflags+%22golang%22+path%3AMakefile). Not _all_ of these are embedding version information in `ldflags`, but most of them are.

Goreleaser also [documents support for this](https://goreleaser.com/cookbooks/using-main.version/), which has [another five thousand hits](https://github.com/search?q=path%3Agoreleaser.yaml+ldflags&type=code).

And what's worse, they're all doing the same thing in a very non-standard way, not just writing `main.commit`, but all kinds of stuff like

- [`github.com/containerd/containerd/v2/version.Revision`](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/v2.0.4/version/version.go#L31)
- [`github.com/docker/cli/cli/version.GitCommit`](https://github.com/docker/cli/blob/v28.0.4/cli/version/version.go#L8)
- [`k8s.io/client-go/pkg/version.gitCommit`](https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go/blob/kubernetes-1.32.3/pkg/version/base.go#L60)
- [`k8s.io/release-utils/pkg/version.gitCommit`](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/release-utils/blob/v0.11.1/version/version.go#L44)
- and tons more. The cargo-cult has spread far and wide.

And, because `ldflags` doesn't care if those values are set, and doesn't care if the value you set doesn't exist, a lot of people _think_ they're doing something when they're not.

Aaaanyway, sometimes folks also wanted a build date embedded, and okay, sure, we can do that too:

```
go build -ldflags="-X 'main.buildDate=$(date +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'"
```

Boom, done. Except...

That's going to cause your build to be non-reproducible. If you build that right now, wait ten seconds, and build it again, you'll get a new binary. You probably don't care that they were built 10 seconds apart from the same source. What you _wanted_ was

```
go build -ldflags="-X 'main.buildDate=$(date -d@$SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'"
```

and some sane static value of `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` to make that reproducible. Most folks would opt for the date of the commit that it's built from as a sane approach.

As an aside, `k8s.io/client-go` had a [fun bug](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/99376) where the way they were embedding the abbreviated Git commit would sometimes make the dependency non-reproducible, leading to [non-reproducible builds for anything that depended on that package](https://github.com/ko-build/ko/issues/315), of which there are ...many.

_But you don't need to do any of this nonsense at all, so stop!_

**Since Go 1.12, back in 2019**, the Go compiler has embedded this information for you, without you needing to know what an `ldflag` is. You can just call [`debug.ReadBuildInfo`](https://pkg.go.dev/runtime/debug#ReadBuildInfo) and it'll pop right out, along with a bunch of other stuff. In Go 1.24 (Feb 2025), more VCS information was made available.

The `vcs.revision` and `vcs.time` are exactly the same as `git rev-parse HEAD` and "the date of that commit". So stop mucking with `ldflags`, and _especially_ stop embedding a non-reproducible time. You're working too hard.

This package demonstrates embedding `vcs.revision`, `vcs.time` and `vcs.clean` (whether there are non-committed changes), and the main package version, and encapsulates it in `version.Get`.

If you `go run ./cmd/example` there will be no embedded version info. If you `go build` and then run it, you'll get version info. If you `go install github.com/imjasonh/version/cmd/example@latest` you'll get the specific tag, for the latest semver tag.

If you want to change anything about the behavior, copy the code and go for it. I wrapped it in a [`sync.OnceFunc`](https://pkg.go.dev/sync#OnceFunc) so it didn't have to read the info each time, in case you call it multiple times. You're welcome.
